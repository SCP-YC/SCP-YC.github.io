            <p><b>Item #: </b>SCP-YC-003</p>
            <p><b>Object Class: </b><del>Thaumiel</del> Safe</p>
            <p><b>Special Containment Procedure: </b>In order to prevent the misuse of SCP-YC-003, only personnel with level 3 clearance are allowed to enter the stations of installations connected to SCP-YC-003. Any operations in the control centres may only be conducted with permission from personnels with level 4 clearance.
            <p>When disseminating information about SCP-YC-003, all civilian witnesses are treated with Class A amnesics. SCP-YC-003 is monitored 24/7 for incoming signals from other radio telescope and radio emitting equipment by assigned personnel. When a signal is received, the corresponding equipment is immediately secured by the nearest MTF unit. All personnel at the seized facility will also be treated with Class A amnesics and assigned to another radio emitting facility under the pretext of transfer for urgent maintenance.</p></p>
            <p><b>Description: </b>SCP-YC-003 is an abnormal radio frequency which can not be detected with conventional devices, all attempts to manually connect radio emitting systems with SCP-YC-003 have failed until now. SCP-YC-003 connects seemingly randomly with compatible equipment, a pattern could not be determined. SCP-YC-003 can be analyzed with already connected devices, the frequency is ████ kHz. It is believed that SCP-YC-003 is four-dimensional.</p>
            <p>SCP-YC-003 has an anomalous property that allows information to be sent out and received in four-dimensional hyperspace. Several tests have already been carried out (see "YC-003 series/CODE_F/1"). To send a quantity of information the following measures are necessary:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the information has a physical form, it will first be converted into digital data using the device specifically designed for SCP-YC-003 called "IIMG" .<sup>1</sup></li>
                <li>If the subject is a living being, it must not have any life-threatening diseases.<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>The process of sending must not take place without a supervisor with level 4 clearance or higher.</li>
                <li>In case of unstructured use of the IIMG, the information may be damaged.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It should be noted that sending Foundation staff is prohibited. This entails disciplinary consequences.</p>
            <p>When sending, the digital information is first input to a terminal and a signal is sent over the frequency, resulting in the triggering of the abnormal characteristic of SCP-YC-003. According to testimony, you can hear a loud humming-like noise in the corresponding facility. If an object has been transported, it will appear at the same coordinates as specified by the IIMG. The specified conditions (dimension, signal, final position) are absolute and will definitely occur.</p>
            <p>Trials have identified multiple patterns of signals that affect various data delivery characteristics. Furthermore, it is possible with so-called "Subsignals" to define the sending more accurate. These consist of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Signal "α": the data is sent to the past.</li>
                <ul><li>Subsignal "α-I": allows determination of the past.</li></ul>
                <li>Signal "β": the data will be sent to the future.</li>
                <ul><li>Subsignal "β-II": allows determination of the future.</li></ul>
                <li>Signal "γ": the data is sent to the four-dimensional hyperspace. All traces of the data have disappeared.</li>
                <li><del>Signal "δ": the data will be [DATA EXPUNGED]. Note the possibility of a paradox.</del></li>
                <ul><li><del>Subsignal "δ-X": [DATA EXPUNGED]</del></li></ul>
            </ul>

            <p>There are three stages of frequency change in the activation of the anomalous property of SCP-YC-003, the first stage describes the slow shortening of the wavelengths of SCP-YC-003, which triggers the fundamental change of SCP-YC-003.<sup>3</sup>The second stage is the rapid extension of these wavelengths. The third stage represents the restoration of the "normal state" of SCP-YC-003. After the completion of the second process of the frequency change, the transport of the information takes place beside the third stage.</p>
            <p>SCP-YC-003 is mostly associated with modernised equipment used for research purposes. After the successful connection, these are referred to as "SCP-YC-003-A/B/C...". To distinguish the different stations, they are marked with a letter in alphabetical order. Since SCP-YC-003 cannot be received by "conventional" devices, it is assumed that SCP-YC-003 causes some kind of modification to the corresponding installation. How SCP-YC-003 determines whether the installation is "suitable" is not yet known.</p>
            <p><b>Addendum: </b>It was found that already connected installations can "interact" with each other. A connection between SCP-YC-003-A and SCP-YC-003-L has been detected, allowing a stronger performance to be achieved. SCP-YC-003-A can send much more data than other systems.</p>
            <p><b>Discovery: </b>The first connection to SCP-YC-003 was found on the radio telescope in ██████████ after local reports of time travelers. All witnesses were treated with Class A amnesic. The "SCP-YC-003-A" designation was given to the corresponding facility.</p>

                <p>The incident YC-003-G/CODE_DELTA occurred on ██.██.20██ where the plant SCP-YC-003-G was destroyed and an anomalous field was generated in which space-time seems to be distorted. Current knowledge infers that it is a local area CK or ZK Class reality reconstruction scenario. Further research did not return valid results. No survivors were found.</p>
                <p>In response to the incident, the use of the signal "δ" and its sub-signal "δ-X" was considered unsuitable for testing.</p>

                <p>Appendix-1: Several unknown signals have already been received. Most incoming signals are received by SCP-YC-003-A, possibly because it is the most powerful system.</p>
                <p>Appendix-2: On ██.██.20██ a test was carried out with the signal "γ". This consisted of sending the digital characters "Is anyone there?" and, if available, observing the reaction. Two hours after sending the message, a response was received in the form of a Morse code. Further replying to the received message did not result in any reaction.</p>
